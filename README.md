# Huffman_coding-Compression-and-Decompression-
 Huffman Coding (04/2022 - 04/2022) This project is to design compression and decompression programs based on
huffman coding.The idea of Huffman Coding is to minimize the weighted expected length of the code by means of
assigning shorter codes to frequently-used character and longer codes to seldom-used code
